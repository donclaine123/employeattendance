üì± Design and Implementation of a Web-Based QR Code Attendance and Monitoring System for Employees of St. Clare College of Caloocan

A secure, role-based attendance system designed to replace manual logs with automated, tamper-resistant digital tracking ‚Äî built for real-world adoption at SCC. 

üöÄ Project Overview
This system enables St. Clare College of Caloocan employees to log daily attendance by scanning a unique QR code via any web browser ‚Äî no app install required. Built with evolutionary prototyping, the system evolved through real feedback from HR and administrative staff to ensure usability, security, and institutional fit.

üéØ Primary Goals:

Eliminate proxy attendance
Reduce manual workload for HR
Provide real-time monitoring for supervisors
Generate accurate, exportable reports for payroll
Ensure data privacy and auditability

üßë‚Äçüíº User Roles

Employee
Login ‚Üí Scan QR ‚Üí View own logs
Department Head
View & export attendance for their team only
HR Admin
Generate QR codes, manage employees, view/export all data
Super Admin
Full system access, user management, backup/restore

üîê No self-registration. All accounts created by HR or Super Admin.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap (mobile-responsive)
Backend: PHP (Laravel) / Node.js (pick one)
Database: MySQL
QR Library: qrcode.js (client-side) or server-side generator
Hosting: XAMPP (local dev), deployable on Render, Railway, or Vercel
Security: Password hashing (bcrypt), session timeout, input sanitization

üîÑ System Flow (Simplified)
Morning: HR Admin generates daily QR code.
Employee: Logs in ‚Üí scans QR ‚Üí system records time-in + status (On Time / Late).
Real-Time: Dashboard updates for HR & supervisors.
End of Day: HR exports PDF/Excel report for payroll.
Audit: All actions logged. No deletions ‚Äî only ‚ÄúInvalid‚Äù flags.


üìå System Documentation (Guidelines & Roadmap)
1. System Overview

Web-based QR Code Attendance & Monitoring System for employees.

Purpose: Automate attendance, reduce errors, prevent proxy logins, and provide HR with accurate reports.

2. Core Features

Employee Authentication

Login using employee ID + password (later maybe OTP or email verification).

QR Code Attendance

Each session/day generates a unique QR code.

Employees scan it to log attendance.

Attendance Monitoring

Time-in / time-out tracking.

Daily, weekly, monthly reports.

Admin Dashboard

View attendance logs.

Export reports (CSV/PDF).

Detect anomalies (e.g., multiple scans).

Notifications (Optional)

Email confirmation of attendance.

Reminders for missing time logs.

3. Guidelines for Development

Use Evolutionary Prototyping: build a basic working version ‚Üí get feedback ‚Üí refine.

Keep it Simple First: start with login + QR scan + basic reports.

Security First:

Prevent multiple scans in the same period.

Validate employee identity.

Scalability: System should handle growing employee records.

4. Roadmap (Phases)

Phase 1: Core Attendance

Employee login.

QR scan attendance (time-in).

Basic database logging.

Phase 2: Time-out + Reports

Add time-out scanning.

Generate attendance reports.

Admin dashboard (basic).

Phase 3: Security Enhancements

Prevent duplicate/proxy scans.

Add session control.

Phase 4: Usability Features

Notifications / summaries.

Export functions (PDF/Excel).

Mobile responsiveness.



üìë Functional Requirements Specification (FRS)
"Design and Implementation of a Web-Based QR Code Attendance and Monitoring System for Employees of St. Clare College of Caloocan"

1. Introduction

This FRS defines the functional requirements for the Web-Based QR Code Attendance and Monitoring System. It specifies the system behaviors, inputs, outputs, and interactions to ensure accurate and secure employee attendance tracking.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1 User Authentication & Security

FR-1: The system shall allow employees, supervisors, HR, and super admin to log in using a unique ID and password.

FR-2: Passwords shall be stored using hashing (e.g., bcrypt/MD5).

FR-3: The system shall automatically log out users after 15 minutes of inactivity.

FR-4: The system shall restrict access based on role permissions.

2.2 QR Code Generation

FR-5: The system shall generate a unique, encrypted QR code for attendance daily.

FR-6: Only the HR admin can generate the official QR code for the day.

FR-7: Generated QR codes shall expire after 24 hours or once the attendance window closes.

2.3 Attendance Logging

FR-8: Employees shall be able to scan the QR code using their device camera via the browser.

FR-9: The system shall record the following data upon successful scan:

Employee ID

Full Name

Department

Date & Time-In

Attendance Status (On Time / Late / Absent)

FR-10: The system shall prevent duplicate attendance logs for the same day unless it is a valid time-out entry.

FR-11: The system shall notify the employee if their scan is successful or invalid.

2.4 Monitoring & Reporting

FR-12: Supervisors shall view attendance records only for employees under their department.

FR-13: HR shall view attendance records for all employees across the institution.

FR-14: The system shall allow filtering of attendance records by:

Date

Department

Status (Present, Late, Absent)

FR-15: The system shall automatically flag employees as Late if their log time is after the set schedule.

FR-16: The system shall automatically mark employees as Absent if no scan is recorded for the day.

FR-17: The system shall provide export functionality (CSV/PDF) for reports.

2.5 Security & Integrity

FR-18: The system shall block QR scans from unregistered or unauthorized users.

FR-19: The system shall store all admin actions (add/edit/delete) in an activity log.

FR-20: The system shall maintain an audit trail of changes in attendance records.

FR-21: The system shall reject attendance scans from devices outside the SCC network (if geolocation/IP restriction is enabled).

2.6 User & System Management

FR-22: HR and Super Admin shall be able to add, edit, and delete employee accounts.

FR-23: Supervisors shall not have access to employee account management.

FR-24: Super Admin shall have the ability to back up and restore the database.

FR-25: The system shall provide a dashboard showing real-time attendance logs.

3. Non-Functional Notes (Optional to include here)

Though mainly covered in the SRS, the FRS assumes the following constraints:

The system shall be mobile-responsive and work on common browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).

The system shall process QR scan validation in under 2 seconds.

The system shall support at least 200 concurrent users during peak time.
