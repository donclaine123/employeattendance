# Employee Attendance System Development Guide

## 📋 System Analysis & Adaptation Plan

### Current Student System Overview
The existing QrCode-Attendance system is designed for educational institutions with:
- **Student Role**: Scan QR codes for class attendance
- **Teacher Role**: Generate QR codes, manage classes, view attendance reports
- **Class-based Structure**: Organized around subjects, classes, and academic sessions
- **Simple Authentication**: Email/password with role-based access

### Employee System Requirements
Based on the README.md requirements, we need to transform this into:
- **Employee Role**: Scan QR codes for daily work attendance (time-in/time-out)
- **Department Head Role**: View and export attendance for their department only
- **HR Admin Role**: Generate QR codes, manage employees, view/export all data
- **Super Admin Role**: Full system access, user management, backup/restore
- **Work-based Structure**: Organized around departments, shifts, and daily attendance

---

## 🔄 Key Transformations Required

### 1. **User Role System Changes**

#### Current Student System Roles:
```javascript
// Current roles
- student: Basic QR scanning for classes
- teacher: Generate QR, manage classes, view reports
```

#### New Employee System Roles:
```javascript
// New roles needed
- employee: Basic QR scanning for daily attendance
- department_head: View/export department attendance only
- hr_admin: Generate QR, manage employees, view/export all data
- super_admin: Full system access, user management, backup/restore
```

### 2. **Database Schema Adaptations**

#### Users Table Modifications:
```sql
-- Current student-focused fields
studentId -> employeeId
role (student/teacher) -> role (employee/department_head/hr_admin/super_admin)

-- New fields needed:
department VARCHAR(100)
position VARCHAR(100)
hire_date DATE
shift_start TIME
shift_end TIME
supervisor_id INT (for department hierarchy)
```

#### Attendance Structure Changes:
```sql
-- Current: Class-based attendance
classes table -> departments table
sessions table -> daily_qr_sessions table
attendance table -> employee_attendance table

-- New fields for employee attendance:
time_in TIMESTAMP
time_out TIMESTAMP
status ENUM('present', 'late', 'absent', 'half_day')
work_date DATE
department_id INT
```

### 3. **UI/UX Component Mapping**

#### Dashboard Transformations:
| Current Student Dashboard | New Employee Dashboard |
|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Quick Scan (for classes) | Quick Scan (daily attendance) |
| Classes Attended Count | Days Present This Month |
| Student Information | Employee Information |
| Recent Activity (classes) | Recent Attendance Log |

#### Admin Dashboard Changes:
| Current Teacher Dashboard | New HR Admin Dashboard |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Generate QR (per class) | Generate Daily QR Code |
| Manage Classes | Manage Employees |
| View Class Attendance | View All Attendance |
| Class Reports | Payroll Reports |

### 4. **Feature Adaptations**

#### QR Code Generation:
```javascript
// Current: Class-specific QR codes
generateQRCode(classId, subject, section)

// New: Daily organizational QR codes  
generateDailyQRCode(date, validUntil)
```

#### Attendance Logic:
```javascript
// Current: Class attendance tracking
recordClassAttendance(studentId, sessionId)

// New: Daily work attendance
recordWorkAttendance(employeeId, qrCodeId, type: 'time_in'|'time_out')
```
